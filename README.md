# CRUD-OPERTION

In this mini project ,CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—are the fundamental operations used in web applications to manage data. In Django, these operations are handled efficiently through its powerful Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture. 

The Create operation allows users to add new records to the database. This is typically done using an HTML form where the user inputs data, which is then sent via a POST request to the Django view. The view processes the form, validates the input, and saves the new object to the database. 

The Read operation retrieves and displays existing data. In Django, this is done using model queries to fetch data, which is then passed to a template and rendered as HTML for the user to view. 

The Update operation lets users modify existing records. It involves pre-filling an HTML form with current data using Django's form instance, allowing users to edit and submit changes, which are then saved back to the database. 

Finally, the Delete operation allows users to remove records. This is commonly implemented with a confirmation page, and upon user confirmation, the record is deleted from the database. Together, these operations enable full data management in Django web applications, with HTML providing the interface for user interaction.
